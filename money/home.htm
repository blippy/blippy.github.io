<h1>home</h1>

<hr><h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>
Your home is not counted as capital if the following people still live there:
<ul>
	<li>spouse</li>
	<li>close relative 60 or over</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>It is also possible to set up a trust.

<hr><h2>CGT</h2>
<p>
Giving a property away is a disposal for CGT, but it doesn not apply to your main residence.
</p>

<hr><h2>IHT</h2>
<p>
If you give an asset to someone within the 7 years before you die, the person who receives the gift may have to pay IHT on it. It is against the law to transfer ownership of an asset to another person specifically to avoid paying your care home fees.
</p>

<p>
The tax threshold for IHT from 06-Apr-2009 to 05-Apr-2017 is &pound;325,000.
</p>

<p>
There is also a nil band for residences of &pound;175,000 for 2020/1. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-main-residence-nil-rate-band-and-the-existing-nil-rate-band/inheritance-tax-main-residence-nil-rate-band-and-the-existing-nil-rate-band">source</a>.
</p>

<p>
The house is likely to be well within the bands, as rightmove shows that The Byre <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/detailMatching.html?prop=46324287&sale=20169661&country=scotland">sold</a> for &pound;345,000 in Jun 2017, and it is a large 5-bedroom house.
