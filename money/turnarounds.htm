<hr><h2>How to spot them</h2>

<ul>
	<li>it is safer to back blue-chips</li>
	<li>a company is not necessarily in trouble if its sales are falling. If it is curring costs faster than receipts are falling, its financial situation could be improving</li>
	<li><b>improving gross margins is one of the best ways to spot a turnaround candidate</b></li>
	<li>sales and admin costs should also be falling. If not, it means management has not done any necessary belt-tightening</li>
	<li>rising cash</li>
</ul>
