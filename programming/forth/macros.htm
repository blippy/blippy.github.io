<h1>forth 'macros'</h1>

Forth is an extensive and powerful language, but it is difficult to figure out how to create "macros", i.e. words
which change the language itself. Macros are achieved through <code>IMMEDIATE</code>.

<p>

In versions 1 and 2 of my 
<a href="https://github.com/blippy/cerbo/tree/master/forth">bbf</a> (barebones Forth) system, I used
convoluted tricks to inline immediate words. Having toyed with the 
<code>gforth</code> system, I figured that I could use a word like 
<code>POSTPONE</code> to work with both immediate and non-immediate words. This is the method I 
describe here. v3 still uses the word <code>COMPILE</code>  internally, but your use of it is
discouraged.

<p>The best way to start off is not to use macros. Suppose we want to print out a countdown. Here's how we might do it

<pre>
: x 5 [ here ] dup .  1 - dup ?branch [ , ]  drop ;
x \ outputs: 5 4 3 2 1
.s \ just confirm that the stack is empty
</pre>

Let's try to abstract away the loop structuring. Like so:

<pre>
: begin 	here ; immediate
: ?again 	postpone ?branch , ; immediate
\ Then we can write
: y 		5 begin dup . 1 - dup ?again drop ;
y
.s
</pre>

Actually, bbf already defines begin and ?again, so there's no need to define it ourselves.

<p>

Let's take it one step further. Suppose we didn't like the immediate word 
<code>?again</code>,
and wanted to alias it. I've gotten into all sorts of contortions trying to make it work
without crashing, and I found the easiest solution was to create a convenience word, like so:


<pre>
: unless	postpone ?again ; immediate
</pre>

Then use it in the intuitive way:

<pre>
: z     5     begin dup . 1 - dup unless        drop ;
z
.s
</pre>



<hr><h2>Embedding literals</h2>

Suppose you wanted to embed numbers in a word. Under bbf, you can do that for a non-immediate word:


<pre>
: f  [ 1 2 + ] literal  ;
." Expect: 3 3" cr
f  . f  . cr
</pre>

To embed in an immediate word:


<pre>
: n23     23  postpone literal    ; immediate
: nn n23 . cr ;
." Expect 23:" cr
nn
</pre>


<hr><h2>COMPILE and [COMPILE] (ANS)</h2>

[COMPILE] is an immediate word, COMPILE is not. 

When creating immediate words, you use COMPILE to compile in non-immediate words, and [COMPILE] for immediate words.

<p>

For example, suppose we want to construct the word ?EXIT which leaves a word if the top of the stack is true,
but continues on if the TOS is false. Here's how it would be defined:

<pre>
: ?EXIT  [compile] if compile exit [compile] then ; immediate
</pre>

Not that `IF` amd 'THEN` are immediate words, whilst `EXIT` is not.

You can then use it in the following way:

<pre>
: eg 0 ?exit 12 . 0 ?exit 13 . 1 ?exit 14 . ; 
eg
</pre>

will output 12 13. The 14 will not be output.
