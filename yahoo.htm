<h1>Yahoo</h1>

<hr>
As of November 2017, downloading share prices from Yahoo Finance does not seem work, at least not fluidly. They seemed to have changed their protocols, which may involve something like cookie crumbs, or some such nonsense.

	- a bash script in redact that downloads a decade's worth of data for a ticker. 
	From my project <code>h5mc</code>.  Pass the ticker in as first argument 
	(e.g. VOD.L). It is case-sensitive, and save the file with the same name as the 
	ticker. It seems preferrable to Pythonic solutions, which often require a 
	lot of infrastructure.
