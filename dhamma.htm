<hr><h2>AN.53 - Reasons for giving</h2>

There are, O monks, eight reasons for giving. What eight? People may give out of affection; or in an
angry mood; or out of stupidty; or out of fear; or because of thinking: "Such gifts have been
given before by my father and grandfather and it was done by them before; hence it would be unworthy
of me to give up this old family tradition"; or because of thinking, "By giving this gift,
I shall be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, after death"; or because of thinking
"When giving this gift, my heart will be glad, and happiness and joy will arise in me"; or one gives
because it ennobles and adorns the mind.

<hr><h2>Upajjhatthana Sutta</h2>

Five rememberances:
<ol>
	<li>I am sure to become old; I cannot avoid ageing</li>
	<li>I am sure to become ill; I cannot avoid illness</li>
	<li>I am sure to die; I cannot avoid death</li>
	<li>I must be separated and parted from all that is dear and beloved to me</li>
	<li>I am the owner of my actions, heir of my actions, actions are the womb (from which I have sprung), actions are my relations, actions are my protection. Whatever actions I do, good or bad, of these I shall become the heir.</li>
</ol>
